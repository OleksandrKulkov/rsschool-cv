### **About myself:**

**Work experience:**

_2012-02/2022_ - Private entrepreneur–tea school (my own educational project) and a small online tea shop with unique tea. I created [my first website](https://teahut.com.ua) on Joomla CMS for them in 2014.

_2001-2012_ - Private entrepreneur–DJ, photographer, videographer (corporate sector).

_2001-2004_ - Sound engineer–film dubbing on Kyiv Dovzhenko Film Studio.

**Personal qualities:**
responsible, decent, daring, easy-going. I am a "diver" in my studies and work—I can easily delve into details and I try to understand the essence. I think critically and plan realistically.

**Hobby, free time:**
Tea ceremony, meditation, music, photography, and I like reading very much (maybe 50 books a year).
